# Myoptic theme

Coding is extremely taxing on our eyes. Reading constantly, scanning for keywords and trying to understand code written by someone else can require a lot of work.

On top of this, if you are someone who suffers from myopia (or other forms of visual impairment), you will find it difficult to read dark themes due to the halo effect lights can produce.

Unfortunately dark themes seem to be the defacto standard for coding, but I think long-term it makes more sense to have a light theme with darker text and easy visual queues with aesthetic, but bold, colors.

## Theory

I created the Myoptic theme after research on best practices for color theory and contrast. I wanted to also push the use of orange due to the color theory of orange being "optimism, confidence, enthusiasm, warmth, and agreeableness" which I find important for coding. Think of it as potentially a brain hack, maybe.

The idea is to make orange primary and so you see more of it.

Purple is secondary due to it's calming and soothing effect on the eyes.

Red for errors and warnings.

Green for comments and secondary text.

Blue for... excess. I wanted to limit the blue due to blue light being the most harmful to eyes, and let's face it, we already are using a light theme so it's probably a lot anyways. Simple fix, use blue light blocking glasses or tools.

Black (but not too black) text for regular text.

White for background.

## So much white

I also wanted everything to blend. You'll notice not many borders so we reduce the distracting effect of containered areas like the side bar, title bar and activity area.

This theme is still in progress, but I think it's a good start and I'm happy with it.

It's primary focus is on:
- Javascript
- Typescript
- HTML
- CSS
- Liquid
- Markdown

But it does also contain support for other languages. If you have any suggestions for other languages, please let me know.
